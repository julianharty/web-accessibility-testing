# web-accessibility-testing
This project provides a proof-of-concept of various ways automated tests can help detect bugs in the design and implementation of web apps and web sites.

It was originally created and implemented around 2010 and 2011. The codebase would need updating to work with current versions of Selenium/WebDriver. If you would like to get involved I would be willing to help you bring the code up-to-date.

This project was automatically exported from code.google.com/p/web-accessibility-testing which has now been retired.
